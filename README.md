# wireframing
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.Its importance lies in turning abstract ideas into clear visual structures, improving communication among team members and stakeholders. It helps identify usability issues early, saving time and resources. By providing a simple layout, it allows for effective planning and easy modifications. It also guides the design process and keeps the focus on functionality and user experience.
